<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The Ride-UI-Kit is a shared front end component library that is used across all of Ride Report front end repositories.

It includes:

- Commonly used React Components (buttons and charts)
- Assets (logos and svgs)
- Whatever else you can think of!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To import the library into your project, we install via npm through the Github Repo URL.

```
npm install git@github.com:RideReport/ride-ui-kit/src.git#main
```

Then you can import it as you would with any other component using ES6 syntax:

```
import { Button } from 'ride-ui-kit';

function Example() {
    return <Button label={'omg it worked'} />
}
```

### Prerequisites

Node
NPM
maybe include nodeversion manager? -> create-react-app requires a higher version of node than the component library

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RideReport/ride-ui-kit.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run Rollup to build the dist files
   ```
   npm run rollup
   ```

### Developing in Watch Mode

You can develop components within the repository using a ver ybasic react app that imports the package locally.

1. From the top-level of the project run `npm run watch`
2. Open up a new project terminal window and from the root `cd demo`
3. Start the react app with `npm run start`

Every time you make changes within the component library it should be automatically rebundled by rollup and served to the react app for hot reloading effects.
